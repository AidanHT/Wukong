# Changelog

All notable changes to Mercury are documented here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project follows semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Front-end**: lexer (with `@attributes` and error recovery), recursive-descent + Pratt parser,
  AST with a pretty-printer, and `--emit=tokens|ast`.
- **Types & semantics**: the shared type vocabulary (`mercury_types`), name resolution, type
  checking, and **compile-time shape checking** for tensors (rank/dimension unification, symbolic
  dims), with errors `E0501`/`E0502`.
- **Middle-end**: block-parameter SSA MIR, a builder, a pretty-printer, and a verifier with a
  `MirLevel` invariant; AST → MIR lowering (alloca-per-local).
- **Optimizer**: a fixpoint pass manager backed by CFG and dominator analyses (Cooper–Harvey–Kennedy
  immediate dominators + dominance frontiers), with whole-program leaf-function `inlining`, `mem2reg`
  (promote scalar slots to block-parameter SSA), `simplify` (constant folding + algebraic identities
  + self-comparison folding), `simplify-cfg` (constant-branch folding + straight-line block merging +
  unreachable-block pruning), `simplify-phis` (dead/trivial block-parameter elimination), `dce`,
  `cse` (dominator-tree value numbering with load forwarding), `dse` (dead-store elimination), and
  `licm` (loop-invariant code motion), wired across `-O0..-O3`. In debug builds the pass manager
  verifies the MIR after every pass. Across the run suite and kernels, `-O3` removes ~48% of IR ops
  (54–60% on the heavy kernels) and runs ~1.5–2.5x faster than `-O0` under the interpreter.
- **Back-ends**: a zero-dependency MIR interpreter (`--run`) and a textual LLVM-IR emitter
  (`--emit=llvm-ir`, plus `--emit=obj|exe` via `clang` when present).
- **Arrays**: fixed-size `[T; N]` run end to end — literal/repeat initializers, indexed load/store
  with a runtime index, and array parameters passed by base pointer (out-params work). Real kernels
  (dot product, SAXPY, a flat GEMM) run on the interpreter.
- **Intrinsics**: `print`/`println` (captured stdout) and `assert` (traps on false).
- **Runtime**: a bump `Arena` allocator and a deterministic `parallel_for`.
- **Diagnostics**: rustc-style renderer, a stable error-code catalog with `--explain <CODE>`, and
  `--error-format=json` (JSON Lines).
- **Tooling & tests**: end-to-end run-suite with `// EXPECT-*` directives, an opt-level differential
  test (`-O0` vs `-O1/-O2/-O3`), per-stage `--emit` smoke tests, the `mercury_bench` harness (IR-op
  reduction + `-O0`-vs-`-O3` interpreter speedup, doubling as an optimizer-equivalence gate over
  heavy kernels in `bench/kernels`), a GitHub Actions CI (fmt + clippy + test on Linux & Windows),
  and the language guide and internals docs.
- **Performance**: the interpreter pools per-call register files and passes block-parameter arguments
  through a reused buffer, roughly halving its wall-clock; large `[v; n]` array initializers lower to
  a fill loop instead of unrolled stores.

### Changed
- A construct lowering cannot yet handle (tensors, SIMD methods, generics, parallel loops) is now a
  hard `error[C0001]` instead of a warning, and the driver refuses to optimize, run, or codegen a
  module whose lowering failed — so the compiler never emits or executes invalid MIR.

### Notes
- Tensors, SIMD vectors, and the parallel/GPU surface parse and type/shape-check today; full
  execution of those paths and native LLVM linking are in progress.
